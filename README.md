- Basic spending trends

### 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQLite (in-memory, via `sqlite3`)
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🔹 Main Files
- `personal_finance_analytics/Notebooks/personal_finance.ipynb`  
  - Loads `transactions.csv`  
  - Creates in-memory SQL table  
  - Runs SQL-style aggregations (using SQLite)  
  - Plots Income vs Expense trend  
  - Saves `monthly_summary.csv` as output

- `personal_finance_analytics/Notebooks/transactions.csv`  
  – Sample transactions data

- `personal_finance_analytics/Notebooks/monthly_summary.csv`  
  – Summary generated by the notebook

## 📁 Project 2 – Bank Customer Churn Analytics

**Folder:** `bank_churn_analytics/`

### 🔹 Goal
Work with simple bank customer data to:
- Inspect churn (customers leaving the bank)
- Calculate churn counts & churn rate
- Create churn summary grouped by geography

### 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- (Optional later: scikit-learn for ML)
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🔹 Main Files
- `bank_churn_analytics/Notebooks/bank_churn.ipynb`  
  - Loads `customers.csv`  
  - Does basic churn analysis (value counts, churn rate)  
  - Generates `churn_summary_by_country.csv`

- `bank_churn_analytics/Notebooks/customers.csv`  
  – Sample customer dataset

- `bank_churn_analytics/Notebooks/churn_summary_by_country.csv`  
  – Output summary generated by the notebook
